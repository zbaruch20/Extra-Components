# Extra-Components
This repository contains the files for the Extra Components project.

```components.jar``` is written by [Paolo Bucci](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~bucci.2/)
for the Software Sequence (CSE 2221 and CSE 2231) at Ohio State. It is included here as it is needed for the extra components' functionality to work.
For more information about the Software Sequence, see http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software.
For more information about the original components and their documentation, see http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/common/doc.
